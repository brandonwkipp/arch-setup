This repository holds the `ansible` configurations for my adventures in tuning an `Arch Linux` system to combine my two favorite interests: audio and programming.

It is very much a work in progress.

- disable middle button paste
- vital synth
- figure out `bw` workflow
- command aliasing (no `sudo`)
- backups (timeshift, betterFs)
- python sanity
- blender
- talon
- track pad freezing
- hostname
- timezone
