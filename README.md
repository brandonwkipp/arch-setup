# btw-i-use-arch

This repository holds the `ansible` configurations for my adventures in tuning an `Arch Linux` system to combine my two favorite interests: audio and programming.

It is very much a work in progress.

## TODO
- vital synth
- backups config
- track pad freezing
- talon
- samba credentials file
- lv2-plugins (group?)
- LinVST
- yabridge config?

### Wine
[x] Waves Central (v11, but it auto updated to v13.4.1 which still seems to work) 
[x] XLN Installer aka RC-20 (works out of the box, except that it doesn't draw the Noise & Wobble waveforms?)
- Ozone
- Autotune
- FL Studio
- Soundtoys
- iLok
- MPC?
- ProTools?
- Serum?

### Evaluation
- Ardour
- Bitwig Studio
- Harrison Mixbus
- Reaper
